[X] README.md included
[X] Slides included
[X] Code included

## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- The py file created appear to be for your streamlit app. In future create function for your cleaning and modeling. (this will clean up your documentation)

## Good Documentation:

- Good & informative README.md
- Clearly name and organize your folders and files (appears you ran out of time, once bootcamp is over revisit. There were a few untitled notebooks)
- Markdown cell at beginning of .ipynb explains scope and analyis
- Inline code comments were used sparingly, use them more.
- Could use more markdown cells throughout as section headings and explaining logic 

## Proper Data Science:

- Good job working through all the regression models. Future steps are to pick the best one (or ensemble) then work on tuning the model.
- Consider other scoring metrics instead of acc. (Precision)
- Did you have imbalanced classes? I could not find within your notebooks.

## Comments:

- Good job on project 3! :)
- When you get the time take time to revisit this project to clean it up. It appears you have an understanding of the concepts, 
  maybe just need more time to code.
